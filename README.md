# High Level Architecture
![High-level Smart contract architecture](./docs/architecture.png)

- Main contracts: IgnitionFactory, Pool, Vesting.
   - `IgnitionFactory`: This contract will be used to deploy a pair of Pool + Vesting contracts for collaborators.
      - The contract is upgradeable using the TransparentProxy pattern.
      - Collaborators can create a pool by calling the CreatePool function.
    - `Pool`: This contract will serve as the main contract for investors and collaborators for most IDO actions, such as buying tokens, claiming IDO tokens, funding tokens, etc.
      - The Pool Contract uses the Clone (Minimal proxy) pattern to reduce gas fees during deployment.
    - `Vesting`: This contract will be used as a utility contract to separate the vesting logic from the Pool contract.
      - The Vesting Contract uses the Clone (Minimal proxy) pattern to reduce gas fees during deployment.
      - Owner of vesting contract should be a corresponding `Pool` contract. Not an EOA.

- Business logic:

# Step to deploy contracts

Prerequisites:
 - In the IgnitionFactory contract, there are some parameters that need to be configured before production deployments. Please change them to reasonable numbers if needed, depending on your business:
  ```
     /// @dev Lockup duration after TGE Date
    uint public constant LOCKUP_DURATION = 5 minutes;

    /// @dev Minimum galaxy participation fee percentage for pool deployment
    uint16 public constant MINIMUM_GALAXY_PARTICIPATION_FEE_PERCENTAGE = 0;
    /// @dev Minimum crown participation fee percentage for pool deployment
    uint16 public constant MINIMUM_CROWN_FUNDING_PARTICIPATION_FEE_PERCENTAGE = 0;

    /// @dev Maximum galaxy participation fee percentage for pool deployment
    uint16 public constant MAXIMUM_GALAXY_PARTICIPATION_FEE_PERCENTAGE = 5000;
    /// @dev Minumum crown participation fee percentage for pool deployment
    uint16 public constant MAXIMUM_CROWN_FUNDING_PARTICIPATION_FEE_PERCENTAGE = 5000;
    
    /// @dev Maximum TGE Date adjustment when it comes to TGE Update
    uint public constant MAXIMUM_TGE_DATE_ADJUSTMENT = 365 days;
  ``` 

1. Create .env file and fill with private key of deployer, infura key (if you do not use infura endpoint, you can change rpc endpoint of network in hardhat.config.ts)

1. Deploy all IDO Smart contracts (includes Vesting, Pool, PoolFactory) 

```
# For Ethereum
yarn deploy:mainnet 
# For BSC
yarn deploy:binance 
```


2. Deploy a sample contract for all IDO pools

```
# For Ethereum
yarn deploy:mainnet --tags POOL
# For BSC

```

3. Deploy a sample contract for all IDO vesting

```
# For Ethereum

```

3. Deploy contract pool factory (with upgradeable proxy pattern)

```
# For Ethereum
yarn deploy:mainnet --tags FACTORY
# For BSC

```

4. Set implementation contract for pool and vesting in Factory contract

# Step to verify contracts

1. Verify pool contract

# Calculate rate and decimal variable in Pool contract

We have price of 1 IDO Token is x Purchase Token (like: USDT, USDC, BUSD,...)

For short, we will call IDO Token is **Itoken**, Purchase Token is **Ptoken**.

We also call the minimum basic unit of Itoken and Ptoken is **wItoken** and **wPtoken** respectively.

We will call decimal of IDO Token and Purchase Token is **Ide** and **Pde** respectively.

```
1 (IDO Token) = x (Purchase Token)

1 (Itoken) = x (Ptoken)

10^Ide (wItoken) = x*10^Pde (wPtoken)

1 (wItoken) = x*10^(Pde-Ide) (wPtoken)

1 / (x*10^(Pde-Ide)) (wItoken) = 1 (wPtoken)

amount / (x*10^(Pde-Ide)) (wItoken) = amount (wPtoken)

amount (wPtoken) = amount / (x * 10^(Pde-Ide)) (wItoken) = amount * 10^(Ide-Pde) / x (wItoken)
```

But in Solidity, we can not use float number, so if x = 0.005 or Ide < Pde, x and 10^(Ide-Pde) will equal 0.

So we need to store price of IDO token (x) in another way and process in case decimal of IDO Token smaller than one of Purchase Token.

## First, process value of x:

- If x<1 like x = 0.8 = 1/1.25 = 10^2 / 125, then we call store 2 and 125 in contract and then calculate x by x = 10^2 / 125

Let call 125 and 2 in this case are **rate and decimal of x**. For short, we will call them are **ratex** and **dex**, so we have:

> > x = 0.8 = 10^2 / 125 = 10^(dex) / ratex

> > ratex = 10^(dex) / x

Let see 1/0.8 = 1.25, we can not store 1.25 in contract, so {dex} will help us.

Let count the decimal digit of 1.25 >> There are 2 digits in decimal part of this number

So we have {dex} >= 2, rate will be an Integer number, not a float number (like 12.5 or 1.25)

We will set {dex} = 2 and then ratex = 1.25 \* 10^2 = 125. Then we will store {ratex = 125} and {dex = 2} in contract to display the value of x = 10^2 / 125 = 0.8

- If x>=1 like x = 80, so we have rate = 10^(dex) / 80 = 1/80 _ 10^(dex) = 0.0125 _ 10^(dex)

We will store rate in contract, so we need rate is not a float number like 0.0125 >> So {dex} will help us.

Let count the decimal digit of 0.0125 >> There are 4 digits in decimal part of this number

So we have {dex} >= 4, rate will be an Integer number, not a float number (like 12.5 or 1.25)

We will set {dex} = 4 and then rate = 0.0125 \* 10^4 = 125. Then we will store {ratex = 125} and {dex = 4} in contract to display the value of x = 10^4 / 125 = 80

- **Summary, dex = {the number digit of decimal part of 1/x}, ratex = 1/x\*10^(dex)**

- Special case, if 1/x is an irrational number like x = 0.3 >> 1/x = 3.333333333333... or x = 28 => 1/x = 0.0357142857...

We need to increase or limit value of {dex}.

Example with x < 1: x = 0.3 >> 1/x = 3.333333... >> dex is infinity

So we can set dex = 18 and ratex = 3_333333_333333_333333, so {ratex} and {dex} in contract will be {3_333333_333333_333333} and {18} (not absolutely accurate but minimize error in calculation)

Example with x >= 1: x=28 >> 1/x = 0.0357142857142857142857142857142857142857... >> dex is infinity

So we can set dex = 18 and ratex = 35714285714285714, those will be store in contract to display x = 28

## Second, process with Ide - Pde:

Now we have formula to calculate amount of IDO token without x:

amount (wPtoken) = amount _ 10^(Ide-Pde) / x (wItoken) = amount _ 10^(Ide-Pde) \* ratex / 10^(dex) (wItoken) **(1)**

- If Ide < Pde, we can write reverse formula like this: amount (wPtoken) = amount \* ratex / 10 ^ (dex + Pde - Ide) (wItoken).

Pde - Ide > 0, so we can increase {dex} an amount is {Pde-Ide} in contract.

Let call result of dex+Pde-Ide is **final decimal** or **de** for short.

> > amount (wPtoken) = amount \* ratex / 10 ^ de (wItoken). **(2)**

- If Ide >= Pde, we have Pde-Ide < 0, so we consider de = dex, then compare **(1)** and **(2)**, we can declare new {rate} variable:

> > rate = 10^(Ide-Pde) \* ratex

> > amount (wPtoken) = amount \* rate / 10 ^(dex) (wItoken)

And now instead storing value of ratex and dex in contract, we will display price of IDO token (x) by {de} and {rate} value\*\*

- **Summary, if Ide < Pde, rate = ratex, de = dex+Pde-Ide and if Ide >= Pde, rate = ratex\*10^(Ide-Pde), de = dex**

## Conclude and example:

- To display in contract the price of IDO token (x), which is set by user and with meaning 1 IDO token = x Purchase token. Developer need to calculate some value and store in contract, which is called **rate** and **decimal** variable.

```
- dex = {the number digit of decimal part of 1/x}, ratex = 1/x*10^(dex) (with 1/x is irrational number, dex = 18)

- If Ide < Pde, rate = ratex, de = dex+Pde-Ide **OR** if Ide >= Pde, rate = ratex*10^(Ide-Pde), de = dex
```

- In contract, we use formula: **amount (wPtoken) can buy => amount \* rate / 10 ^(de) (wItoken)**

**Example:**

- x = 0.08, Ide = 18, Pde = 6 >> 1/x = 12.5 >> dex = 1 >> ratex = 125 >> rate = 125\*10^12 >> de = 1

Normal: amount = 90 Purchase Token >> can buy 90/0.08 = 1125 IDO Token

Formula: amount = 90 _ 10^6 (wPtoken) >> can buy 90 _ 10^6 _ 125 _ 10^12 / 10 ^1 = 1125 \* 10^18 (wItoken)

- x = 0.028, Ide = 6, Pde = 8 >> 1/x = 35.7142857143... >> dex = 18 >> ratex = 35_714285_714285_714285 >> rate = 35_714285_714285_714285 >> de = 20

Normal: amount = 90 Purchase Token >> can buy 90/0.028 = 3214.285714 IDO Token

Formula: amount = 90 _ 10^8 (wPtoken) >> can buy 90 _ 10^8 \* 35_714285_714285_714285 / 10 ^ 20 = 3214285714 (wItoken)

- x = 10, Ide = 10, Pde = 18 >> 1/x = 0.1 >> dex = 1 >> ratex = 1 >> rate = 1 >> dex = 9

Normal: amount = 90 Purchase Token >> can buy 90/10 = 9 IDO Token

Formula: amount = 90 _ 10^18 (wPtoken) >> can buy 90 _ 10^18 * 1 / 10 ^ 9 = 9*10^10 (wItoken)

- x = 55, Ide = 8, Pde = 6 >> 1/x = 0.01818181818... >> dex = 18 >> ratex = 18181818181818181 >> rate = 1818181818181818100 >> de = 18

Normal: amount = 90 Purchase Token >> can buy 90/55 = 1.636363 IDO Token

Formula: amount = 90 _ 10^6 (wPtoken) >> can buy 90 _ 10^6 \* 1818181818181818100 / 10 ^ 18 = 163636363 (wItoken)
