# ECDSA
[Git Source](https://github.com/Sotatek-LoiNguyen2/ignition-sc/blob/6fd47416ac9b148d4f43e8bb90a990315ae49b42/contracts/libraries/ECDSA.sol)

*Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) operations.
These functions can be used to verify that a message was signed by the holder
of the private keys of a given address.*


## Functions
### _throwError


```solidity
function _throwError(RecoverError error) private pure;
```

### tryRecover

*Returns the address that signed a hashed message (`hash`) with
`signature` or error string. This address can then be used for verification purposes.
The `ecrecover` EVM opcode allows for malleable (non-unique) signatures:
this function rejects them by requiring the `s` value to be in the lower
half order, and the `v` value to be either 27 or 28.
IMPORTANT: `hash` _must_ be the result of a hash operation for the
verification to be secure: it is possible to craft signatures that
recover to arbitrary addresses for non-hashed data. A safe way to ensure
this is by receiving a hash of the original message (which may otherwise
be too long), and then calling {toEthSignedMessageHash} on it.

```solidity

```

### tryRecover

*Overload of {ECDSA-tryRecover} that receives the `r` and `vs` short-signature fields separately.
See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2098[EIP-2098 short signatures]
_Available since v4.3._*


```solidity
function tryRecover(bytes32 hash, bytes32 r, bytes32 vs) internal pure returns (address, RecoverError);
```

### recover

*Overload of {ECDSA-recover} that receives the `r and `vs` short-signature fields separately.
_Available since v4.2._*


```solidity
function recover(bytes32 hash, bytes32 r, bytes32 vs) internal pure returns (address);
```

### tryRecover

*Overload of {ECDSA-tryRecover} that receives the `v`,
`r` and `s` signature fields separately.
_Available since v4.3._*


```solidity
function tryRecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) internal pure returns (address, RecoverError);
```

### recover

*Overload of {ECDSA-recover} that receives the `v`,
`r` and `s` signature fields separately.*


```solidity
function recover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) internal pure returns (address);
```

### toEthSignedMessageHash

*Returns an Ethereum Signed Message, created from a `hash`. This
produces hash corresponding to the one signed with the
https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#eth_sign[`eth_sign`]
JSON-RPC method as part of EIP-191.
See {recover}.*


```solidity
function toEthSignedMessageHash(bytes32 hash) internal pure returns (bytes32);
```

### toEthSignedMessageHash

*Returns an Ethereum Signed Message, created from `s`. This
produces hash corresponding to the one signed with the
https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#eth_sign[`eth_sign`]
JSON-RPC method as part of EIP-191.
See {recover}.*


```solidity
function toEthSignedMessageHash(bytes memory s) internal pure returns (bytes32);
```

### toTypedDataHash

*Returns an Ethereum Signed Typed Data, created from a
`domainSeparator` and a `structHash`. This produces hash corresponding
to the one signed with the
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712[`eth_signTypedData`]
JSON-RPC method as part of EIP-712.
See {recover}.*


```solidity
function toTypedDataHash(bytes32 domainSeparator, bytes32 structHash) internal pure returns (bytes32);
```

## Enums
### RecoverError

```solidity
enum RecoverError {
    NoError,
    InvalidSignature,
    InvalidSignatureLength,
    InvalidSignatureS,
    InvalidSignatureV
}
```
